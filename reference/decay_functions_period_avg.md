# List of period-averaged decay functions (log(1-VE) scale)

These functions return the mean log(1-VE) over 8-week periods, as used
in the toy code.

## Usage

``` r
decay_functions_period_avg()

logistic_decay_period_avg()

logistic_simple_decay_period_avg()

exponential_decay_period_avg()
```

## Value

Vector of averaged log(1-VE) values for each period
